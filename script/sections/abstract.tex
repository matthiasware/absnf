The abs-normal form is a representation of piecewise linear functions.
In this project we implemented basic routines to deal with these functions in CUDA C++.
In particular we wanted to evaluate, solve and calculate the gradient of a given function in abs-normal form.
We tested our implementation for correctness and made several performance benchmarks on multiple devices.
